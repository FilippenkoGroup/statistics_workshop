# Hypothesis Testing
## Background
You're all likely familiar with when science says we have found our results to be statistically significant. In other fields you often hear our results have a p-value of 5%. In astronomy, you more often hear a number between 3 to 5 sigmas. While most of you conceptually understand the concept of significance, here I will show you how to check for significance with two of the most popular hypothesis tests. Before we dive in, I need you to be convinced that the type of significance you and all scientists mostly deal with are ones with some probability or random elements. That is most often when people say their results are significant they mean “our results are significant and not due to random chance”.

## Setting up the Hypothesis
To start doing a hypothesis test we need state clearly two types of hypothesis. The null hypothesis where we suspect the results are insignificant and any differences from what's expected is due to random chance. Then there is the opposite alternative hypothesis which says the differences are not due to random chance but instead some other reason.

In astronomy literature, it is very rare to see authors directly state their null hypothesis. It is up to the readers to infer it from the context.

Well, let's try one. Here is a result from thirty tosses of a die and we want to know if the die is fair meaning all faces of the die have an equal chance of showing up.
